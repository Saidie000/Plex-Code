This folder is for the `sett.woff` font used by PlexCode files.

Place your actual `sett.woff` file here (binary). This repository
contains a placeholder README instead of the font to avoid tracking
large binary files in source control.

If you want this font applied in the Codespace or container, run the
installer script `.vscode/install_sett_font.sh` (it installs to
`~/.local/share/fonts` and refreshes the font cache).
