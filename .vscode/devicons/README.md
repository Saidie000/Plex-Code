This folder contains workspace-specific devicon mappings for the Plex Code
project. It provides a place to store JSON mappings that custom icon themes or
editor utilities can use to associate file extensions or filenames with
icon identifiers.

Files:
- `icons.json`: sample mapping of extensions/filenames to icon keys.

Instructions:
- Install an icon theme (see recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`).
- Edit `icons.json` to add or adjust mappings used by your tooling.

Note: These are local workspace helper files and do not alter licensing or
distribution of project source code.
